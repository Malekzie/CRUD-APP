# WIP
# A basic CRUD APP

To replicate, do `pnpm db:push` on the terminal after running `pnpn i` then, to populate the database, enter `pnpm seed`.


# Stack Used
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) as the Framework
- [Lucia Auth](https://lucia-auth.com) as the Authentication handler
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) as the headless ORM of choice
- [Shadcn-Svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs) for simplifying components
